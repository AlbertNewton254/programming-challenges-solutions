# Programming Challenges Solutions

Solutions to the book "Programming Challenges" by Skiena and Revilla.

## About the Project

This repository contains solutions to problems from the book **"Programming Challenges"** by Steven Skiena and Miguel Revilla. The solutions are organized by chapter and problem, with implementations in different programming languages.

## Repository Structure

Each chapter (`pcXX`) has subfolders for each problem (`pcXX_YY`), which in turn contain the solution in one or more languages:

```
.
├── pc01
│   ├── pc01_01
│   │   └── c/
│   ├── pc01_05
│   │   └── java/
│   └── pc01_08
│       └── python/
├── pc02
│   └── ...
└── pc14
```

## Languages

- **C**
- **Java**
- **Python** (occasionally)

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the desired chapter and problem.
2. Enter the folder for the corresponding language.
3. Compile/run the code as indicated in the comments.
